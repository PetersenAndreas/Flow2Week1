- **Status for the assigment:** I did not get all done with the assigment, but I tried my best to implement it all as good as I could. <br>

## **Struggles**
I had a lot of struggles with the time frame for each assignment. This is also the reason why some of the assigment are "half baked". <br>
I was roughly a day behind the whole week through, besides that I also experinced some technical issues.
